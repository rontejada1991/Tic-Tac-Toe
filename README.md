# Tic-Tac-Toe

My attempt at a tick-tac-toe game for 2 players, using the command line.

Notable features:

- Players are automatically assigned either an "X" or "O" mark when entering their name.
- Players can opt to replay the game once one of them wins.
- If they choose to replay the game, there is no need to re-enter their names or have their marks re-assigned. The game has this stored.
- Wins are stored for each player, to be given once the players have finished playing all of their games.

TO-DO:

- Error checking player input when they attempt to mark a space in on the board and enter out of range numbers or letters.
- A player may "override" marks that another has already made on the board. Per Tic Tac Toe rules, this is not allowed. Players that do this should get another try at selecting a valid choice.
